# Contributing to awesome-topics

Thanks for helping improve this curated map for developers — contributions from anyone are welcome.

What to add
- Ensure the resource is high-quality, relevant to software engineering or developer learning, and not already listed.
- Proposed entry format (in a single list line):
  - [Name](URL) — Short neutral description. (tags)
  - Example: `- [Free Coding Course](https://example.com) — A beginner-friendly course on web fundamentals. (category:learning, language:js, difficulty:beginner)`

Tags
- Use simple tags in parentheses after the description. Common tags: category, language, difficulty, license.
- Tags help readers filter the list and let scripts export machine-readable data.

How to contribute
1. Open a pull request that adds or updates entries in the README under the appropriate section.
2. Keep changes focused and small (one logical change per PR is ideal).
3. If your change is large (reorganizing many items or adding whole learning paths), open an issue first to discuss structure.

Pull request checklist (for contributors)
- [ ] I checked for duplicates.
- [ ] The entry has a short description and tags.
- [ ] Links work (or a note explains a known issue).
- [ ] Changes are limited to the intended section.

Review & maintenance
- This project is community-maintained. Anyone can review and suggest improvements.
- There is no fixed review deadline — maintainers and community members will triage and review PRs as available.
- If you want to take responsibility for a category, mention it in an issue or comment and the community can coordinate.

Automation & formatting
- Try to keep list formatting consistent (Markdown list items).
- Consider running markdown linters locally before opening large PRs.

Thanks — your contribution helps other developers find better resources.
