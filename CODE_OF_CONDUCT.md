Be respectful

- Do not engage in harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.

Be constructive
- Focus feedback on the content and the facts.
- When possible, suggest improvements rather than only pointing out problems.

Reporting

- Reports will be handled respectfully and promptly by project maintainers or community moderators.

Enforcement
- Responses may include a request to stop, moderation of content, or removal from the project for serious violations.
